The `Linguistic Landscapes of Beirut` project (LLB) explores the multi-lingual and multi-script character of Beirut, Lebanon. 

Linguistic landscape studies document and analyze how multilingualism is expressed in a written manner in public space. The LLB project brings together more than 2000 written language samples from the greater Beirut area along with crowd created metadata.

The data represented here was collected in the context of a history of language course offered for majors in the [Department of English](https://www.aub.edu.lb/fas/english/Pages/default.aspx) at the [American University of Beirut](https://www.aub.edu.lb/) in 2015-16. 

This static site is a reworking of the material using minimal principles and open mapping in Leaflet. It has been created with Jekyll and [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). The former project site can be found in [screenshots](https://web.archive.org/web/20181215000000*/llbeirut.org) at the Internet Archive.
